<task>
write a Product Requirement Document (PRD)for Account Creating sceanrio in requirements/core-banking/prd_account_creation.md
read the following docs for reference
requirements/core-banking/README.md
requirements/README.md

Make sure your PRD include the following sections

- Objective/Goal: Explain why are you building this and what do you hope to accomplish.

- Features: For each feature, you should include a description, goal and use case at a minimum. Additional details may be helpful or necessary depending on the complexity of the feature, such as out-of-scope items.

- UX Flow & Design Notes: Most organizations complete the UX design of features after the PRD has been reviewed and accepted. However, there may be some general guidance required at this stage to ensure the release objectives are met. This is not the place for pixel-perfect mockups or wireframes that map out every possible scenario; instead, it can be used to describe the overall user workflow. Use UML diagram where possible to illsutrate the user workflow, use porper mermaid format.

- System & Environment Requirements: Which end-user environments will be supported (such as browsers, operating systems, memory, and processing power, etc.).

- Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies: List out what is expected of users, any limits for the implementation to be aware of and any outside elements required for the final solution to be functional.

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_response tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_response tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.)

<thinking>
To create a comprehensive PRD for the Account Creation scenario, I need to:
1. Read the reference documents to understand the context and requirements
2. Gather information about the current account creation process and any existing requirements
3. Structure the PRD according to the specified sections
4. Use Mermaid diagrams where appropriate to illustrate UX flows
5. Ensure the PRD aligns with the overall project goals and requirements

# Core Banking System Overview

## Overview of a Typical Core Banking System

A core banking system is the central processing unit of a digital bank, handling all fundamental banking operations. It manages customer accounts, processes transactions, and supports various banking services through a unified platform. For a digital bank like The Amazing Bank, the core banking system must be highly scalable, secure, and capable of integrating with modern technologies like AI, blockchain, and real-time analytics.

Key features include:
- Account management (savings, checking, loans, etc.)
- Transaction processing (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
- Customer relationship management
- Integration with digital channels (mobile, web)
- Compliance and security features
- Reporting and analytics

## Architecture Description

The core banking system follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility. Key components include:

1. **API Gateway**: Handles all incoming requests and routes them to appropriate services
2. **Account Service**: Manages customer accounts and balances
3. **Transaction Service**: Processes financial transactions
4. **Customer Service**: Handles customer profiles and relationships
5. **Security Service**: Manages authentication, authorization, and encryption
6. **Reporting Service**: Generates financial reports and analytics
7. **Integration Layer**: Connects with external systems and third-party services

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Gateway] --> B[Account Service]
    A --> C[Transaction Service]
    A --> D[Customer Service]
    A --> E[Security Service]
    A --> F[Reporting Service]
    A --> G[Integration Layer]
    B --> H[(Account Database)]
    C --> I[(Transaction Database)]
    D --> J[(Customer Database)]
```

## Scenario List

| Scenario | Description | Actors | Preconditions | Postconditions |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Account Creation | Customer creates a new bank account | Customer, Account Service | Customer is authenticated | New account is created and linked to customer profile |
| Deposit | Customer deposits funds into account | Customer, Transaction Service | Account exists and is active | Account balance is increased |
| Withdrawal | Customer withdraws funds from account | Customer, Transaction Service | Account exists and has sufficient balance | Account balance is decreased |
| Transfer | Customer transfers funds between accounts | Customer, Transaction Service | Both accounts exist and source account has sufficient balance | Funds are moved from source to destination account |
| Balance Inquiry | Customer checks account balance | Customer, Account Service | Account exists | Current balance is displayed |
| Loan Application | Customer applies for a loan | Customer, Account Service | Customer meets eligibility criteria | Loan account is created and funds are disbursed |
| Fraud Detection | System detects suspicious activity | Security Service, Transaction Service | Transaction patterns are monitored | Suspicious transactions are flagged for review |

I'll update the UX flow and system requirements to explicitly support both mobile and web account creation. Here are the key modifications:

1. **Updated UX Flow**:

    participant Platform
    participant AccountService
    participant SecurityService
    Customer->>Platform: Start Account Creation (Mobile/Web)

    Customer->>SecurityService: Submit Verification
    SecurityService->>AccountService: Verification Result
    AccountService->>Platform: Create Account
    Platform->>Customer: Account Created Confirmation
```

2. **Updated System Requirements**:
   - **Mobile**:
     - iOS 15+
     - Android 10+
     - Minimum RAM: 2GB
   - **Web**:
     - Browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox (latest versions)
     - Minimum Screen Resolution: 1024x768
     - Internet Connection: 4G/LTE or WiFi

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Cross-platform session management
   - Responsive web design for mobile browsers
   - Consistent UI/UX across platforms

Would you like me to include any specific details about the web platform implementation or should I proceed with these updates?

**Assistant:**

<plan_mode_response>
<response>
For the web platform implementation, I recommend adding these specific considerations:

1. **Technical Enhancements**:
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) support for mobile-like experience
   - WebSocket integration for real-time updates
   - Browser storage for session persistence
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing matrix

2. **Security Measures**:
   - CSRF protection for form submissions
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
   - Secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   - CAPTCHA integration for form submissions

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Lazy loading for non-critical resources
   - Image optimization and responsive srcsets
   - Code splitting for JavaScript bundles
   - Service worker for caching and offline support

4. **User Experience Features**:
   - Responsive design with breakpoints for different devices
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Form validation with real-time feedback
   - Progress indicators for multi-step forms

5. **Analytics & Monitoring**:
   - User journey tracking
   - Form abandonment analytics
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error logging and reporting

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or should I incorporate them into the PRD?
